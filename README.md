# Week 3

This lab demonstrates automated unit testing in Javascript using the Mocha framework and Chai library. On completion, you should have a clear understanding of how to structure unit test code and design appropriate test cases for a function or class method specification.

The principles of testing are covered, including:

-Test scenarios - Test design should consider the three runtime scenario: normal, exceptional (if relevant) and error (if applicable).
-Test case isolation.
-Target object state - Some methods modify the target object's state. The tests should prove this behaviour, in addition to ensuring the method response value is correct.
-This lab demonstrates the test-driven development (TDD) methodology for one method specification.
